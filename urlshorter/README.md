url-shortener
=========================

This is an implementation of the freeCodeCamp "url shortener microservice" exercise. 

It's okay, it works. The backend is a mongo db at mlab.com. Not really practical as a url-shortener because the hostname --"https://abounding-environment.glitch.me"-- is so long, but as an exercise it was cool.

NOTE THIS WILL NOT WORK INITIALLY BECAUSE "server.js" REQUIRES LOGIN INFORMATION FOR A MONGODB SERVER. On "glitch.com" where this was developed, that login information was set via environment variables. If you want to try this you will have to use your provide the missing login information in server.js.
