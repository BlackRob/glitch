A place to put my solutions so I can share them :)

## timestamper
Node.js microservice, it accepts a string, parses it for a date, and either returns the date in an object (including unix timestamp form and human-readable version) or null.
Try it at [glitch.com](https://dune-hail.glitch.me/).

## request header parser
Very basic node.js microservice that reads a few pieces of information from the request header and echoes them back in an object.
Try it at [glitch.com](https://mud-tailor.glitch.me/)
